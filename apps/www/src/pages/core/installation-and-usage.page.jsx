			<p>You have to know what JSXPine is composed.</p>
			<p>
				Like <strong>Shadcn</strong>, the main entry point with your application
				is a file named: <em>component.json</em>.
			</p>
			<p>
				This file contains information about propreties which define how
				components from JSXPine will be connected to your project.
			</p>
			<p>These propreties are: </p>
			<ListWithDecimal>
				<li>
					<p>
						<em>$schema</em>: It's an url of the schema propreties of your
						component.json.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<em>tailwind</em>: Because JSXPine uses tailwind for the css part,
						this proprety handles two subpropreties.
					</p>
					<ListWithDot>
						<li>
							<p>
								<span class={"font-medium"}>config.js</span>: This one is about
								your tailwind config file, ie where it's located.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								<span class={"font-medium"}>css</span>: This proprety's value is
								your global css file's path. It will applied everything set in
								this file to your components' style.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ListWithDot>

				<li>
					<p>
						<em>aliases</em>: This proprety handles 3 crucial subpropreties,
						which are highly coupled between them:
					</p>
					<ListWithDot>
						<li>
							<p>
								<span class={"font-medium"}>components</span>: This is the path
								of the folder where all components will be moved when added via
								cli{" "}
								<a href="#add-command" class={"link link-primary"}>
									(see here for more details)
								</a>
								. This value is also to be set in your tsconfig's path array.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								<span class={"font-medium"}>scripts</span>: Since JSXPine tries
								to use javascript in a better way, it suggests a folder called
								scripts when you can put all your logic, utilities or whatever
								you want as js code for your project. By default, it contains a
								subfolder named <span class={"italic"}>alpine</span>. Therefore,
								this key is the path to this folder.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								<span class={"font-medium"}>alpine</span>: It's the path of the
								folder where everything related to alpinejs will be put. JSXPine

								to work with three of them.

			<p>
				The <em>init</em> command aims to prepare all required modules (mostly

			</p>
			<p>There are three optional arguments you can pass to this command:</p>
			<ListWithDot>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>-c</strong> or <strong>--cwd &lt; cwd &gt;</strong>: This
						argument is the project's <strong>absolute</strong> path where
						everything will be installed. When empty, the current directory
						where the command is running is considered ;
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>-y</strong> or <strong>--yes</strong>: Will skip
						confirmation prompt ;
					</p>

				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>-h</strong> or <strong>--help</strong>: This command will
						print you in your terminal all commands.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ListWithDot>
			<p>
				When running this command (without --yes argument), several steps will
				be prompt to you:
			</p>
			<ListWithDecimal>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>Global CSS file</strong>: It's basically the main css file
						where all tailwind main function and also your global classes are
						defined.{" "}
						<span class="italic">
							Please note that it will replace everything in this file by the
							boilerplate coming from jsxpine
						</span>
						.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>Tailwind config file</strong>: The init command will look up
						to the tailwind config file. If this file is not found, it exits
						from the the initialization process. Otherwise, it overwrites
						everything contain in this file.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>Components' path</strong>: Because JSXPine is about
						"components", you'll have to define where to store them. This step
						lets you write the relative path of the directory which will contain
						all components added.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>Scripts' path</strong>: As said before, JSXPine uses
						alpinejs. A scripts directory is created to hold all alpinejs
						features, but also everything related to js/ts which can be used by
						either your alpinejs functions, either by your jsx components.
					</p>
					<p>
						By doing this, the goal is to have a single file app.js/ts which
						will be used as source for your script tag.
					</p>
					<p>
						JSXPine promote the old web way,{" "}
						<span class="italic">
