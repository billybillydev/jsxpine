## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

-   updated cli readme

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

-   The wait is over! JSXPine 1.0.0 is here! Our team has worked tirelessly to bring you a robust, reliable, and easy-to-use CLI. Give it a spin and experience the difference !

    The CLI will help you install JSXPine components with two main commands:

    -   init: This one will install all required tools and files needed to use components properly ;
    -   add: With this command, you can add one or many components as you wish ;

    The version 1.0.0 stabilizes these two commands above with a better code refactor.
    Also, a global project refactoring has been done.

    In the usage, nothing really change for the **add** command.

    However, some additional steps have been included in the init command. Learn more in [the website's init command section](https://jsxpine.com/core/installation-and-usage#init-command)

    PS: You can still add manually any components. Go to [https://jsxpine.com/components](https://jsxpine.com/components) and follow the steps for the wanted component.
